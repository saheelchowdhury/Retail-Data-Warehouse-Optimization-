#Datawarehouse now referred as 'datawarehouse' in the next 8 queries analyzing and drawing different insights from the database. 

The data warehouse is designed to understand customer behavior and optimize retail business strategy. It analyzes customer spending, including semi-annual and quarterly subtotals, to evaluate the impact of discounts on sales. The system also tracks the number of orders, a crucial source of revenue, and examines spending on specific product types to gauge customer preferences. 

#Top 10 countries ranked by total contribution to revenue % 

The information is useful when considering how much effort should be put into these individual countries, such as for advertising or marketing/promotions. 

```
SELECT sub.country, sub.country_subtotal_revenue, sub.total_revenue, ROUND((sub.country_subtotal_revenue / sub.total_revenue)*100,2) AS percent_of_revenue
FROM ( SELECT Country, ROUND(SUM(subtotal),2) AS country_subtotal_revenue,
              (SELECT ROUND(SUM(subtotal),2) FROM datawarehouse) AS total_revenue
       FROM datawarehouse
       GROUP BY Country 
       ORDER BY country_subtotal_revenue DESC) AS sub
LIMIT 10;

b.	Customers who are offered the discount but didnâ€™t any value 

Ranking the customers based on discounts provided and ranking their total amount spend to understand the discount's effectiveness. Based on this information, decisions such as : 'whether to give up the customers or keep giving them discounts' - can be taken. 

```
SELECT d.CustomerID, d.subtotal, d.total_discount,  ROUND((d.subtotal + d.total_discount),2) AS original_revenue,
       sub2.percent_of_discount,
	   RANK() OVER(ORDER BY subtotal DESC) AS rank_on_subtotal,
       sub2.rank_on_discount
FROM datawarehouse AS d
JOIN (SELECT sub1.CustomerID, sub1.subtotal, sub1.total_discount, sub1.percent_of_discount, 
	  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY percent_of_discount DESC) AS rank_on_discount
      FROM (SELECT CustomerID, subtotal, total_discount,
                   ROUND((total_discount / (subtotal + total_discount)) * 100,2) AS percent_of_discount
	        FROM datawarehouse) AS sub1) AS sub2
USING (CustomerID)
ORDER BY rank_on_discount;

c.	Subtotal percentage on different shippers given by countries

This query is useful to understand the % distributions of shippers used by different countries. For example, we can see that Denmark takes 56% of their services from 'Federal Shipping'. If 'Federal Shipping' runs into some sort of issue, there will be loss in business. Balanced shipper distribution is recommended. 

```
SELECT Country, 
	   ROUND(subtotal_on_Federal_Shipping / total * 100,2) AS subtotal_percentage_on_Federal_Shipping,
       ROUND(subtotal_on_Speedy_Express / total * 100,2) AS subtotal_percentage_on_Speedy_Express,
       ROUND(subtotal_on_United_Package / total * 100,2) AS subtotal_percentage_on_United_Package
FROM ( SELECT Country, ROUND(SUM(subtotal_on_Federal_Shipping),2) AS subtotal_on_Federal_Shipping, 
              ROUND(SUM(subtotal_on_Speedy_Express),2) AS subtotal_on_Speedy_Express,
              ROUND(SUM(subtotal_on_United_Package),2) AS subtotal_on_United_Package,
              ROUND(ROUND(SUM(subtotal_on_Federal_Shipping),2) + ROUND(SUM(subtotal_on_Speedy_Express),2) + ROUND(SUM(subtotal_on_United_Package),2),2) AS total
       FROM datawarehouse
       GROUP BY Country) AS sub;
